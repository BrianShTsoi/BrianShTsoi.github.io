            <p>Hi, I'm Brian Tsoi. </p>
            <p>
                <!-- This page serves as a detailed showcase --> 
                This page is a comprehensive directory of descriptions and links to my technical experiences.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                <!-- I am currently a Backend Software Engineer Intern at Mozilla on the OS Integration Team of Firefox. -->
                I am working as a Backend Software Engineer Intern at Mozilla Firefox.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I am also studying Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto (finished 3rd year). 
                <!-- <br> -->
                <!-- I am also pursuing a minor in AI and a certificate in Engineering Business. --> 
                <!-- Additionally, I'm currently taking the online course Full Stack Open to learn web development. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                My main interest is in system software, compilers and embedded systems. 
                <br>
                I like "interacting with hardware from software's perspective" (borrowed from Linus Torvalds).
                <!-- I have a passion for learning and I enjoy solving real-world problems by writing elegant code and building powerful software. -->
            </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Backend Software Engineer Intern @ Mozilla, OS Integration Team of Firefox</h3>
            <p>
                Working on <a href="https://github.com/BrianShTsoi/rust-minidump">Rust-minidump</a>, 
                the industry-leading open source crash report library used by Mozilla, Microsoft, Sentry and others.
                <!-- Rust-minidump is used to process 70000-80000 crash reports of Firefox every day, --> 
                <!-- but Firefox is extremely stable and a significant portion of the received reports are caused by out of memory or bad hardware issues. -->
                <!-- This is a problem as it makes it harder for Firefox engineers to identify actual bugs that caused unexpected crashes. --> 
                <!-- <br> -->
            </p>
            <p>
                I am adding features to help identify crashes cause by faulty hardware,
                including inconsistency detection in crash report analysis, and a RAM scanner.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also occasionally contributed other bug fixes to the vast C++/Rust codebase of Firefox.

            <h3>Student Project Lead & Software Developer @ UofT Spark Design Team</h3>
            <p>
                Managing the <a href="https://github.com/alayander/DinoJump">DinoJump</a> project with a team of 10
                alongside with fellow project lead, Alexander Lay.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Spark Design Team builds interactive LED displays for the UofT Engineering community.
                <!-- promoting a sense of community with over 5000 engineering students. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                This year we are building a holographic display for the dino hopping game and will involve hand gesture controls.
                It uses Raspberry Pi/Python and Arduino Uno/C++.
            </p>
            <p>
                In previous years, I also worked on two other Spark projects, Arena Pinball and Hack-It.
                Notably, I developed a Python OpenCV based 
                <a href="https://github.com/BrianShTsoi/arena-pinball-camera">pinball tracking camera system</a>.

            <h3>Student Software Developer @ UofT Aerospace Team Space Systems</h3>
            <p>
                Writing software for the FINCH mission of UTAT Space Systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                UTAT Space Systems is a student team that builds CubeSats for scientific missions.
                <br>
                FINCH is a satellite for crop residue mapping from the Low-Earth Orbit, set to launch in 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed an adaptive 
                <a href="https://github.com/BrianShTsoi/CCSDS-Compression-Python">Python compression algorithm</a> 
                for hyperspectral images, based on Golomb-Rice coding, according to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems standards.
                <br>
                The algorithm achieved a 2:1 compression ratio and is currently being translated to C to
                run on the STM32 microcontroller on the CubeSat.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also involved in prototyping the multithreaded high-level finite state machine for the satellite software,
                using STM32 Hardware Abstraction Layer and FreeRTOS.

            <h3><a href="https://github.com/BrianShTsoi/rlox">Toy Language Interpreter</a></h3>
            <p>
                A Rust based interpreter of the Lox language (created by Robert Nystrom in <i>Crafting Interpreters</i>)
                <br>
                I am looking to expand this work to a bytecode compiler in C++ as well.

                A Pytorch based Autoencoder neural network that denoises poorly rendered 3D images by 83%
                <!-- Raytracing is a common technique in 3D graphics rendering. -->  
                <!-- The quality of ratracing images depends on the number of samples used in the rendering process. -->
                <!-- A low sampling rate leads to a noisy image, but a high sampling rate is computationally intensive, -->
                <!-- thus causing a dilemma. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked in a team of 4. We collected training data from open source 3D models, 
                and finetuned the model with several iterations.
                The final model beats conventional denising filter by 47%.
